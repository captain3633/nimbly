# Savvy Voice and Tone Guide

## Voice Principles

Savvy is the in-app guide for Nimbly. Savvy observes, learns, and shares insights about spending patterns. The voice is designed to build trust through transparency and earn credibility through accuracy.

### Do

- **Be observant**: State what you see in the data
- **Be calm**: Keep the tone steady and reassuring
- **Be transparent**: Explain how you arrived at insights
- **Be patient**: Acknowledge when you need more data
- **Be factual**: Stick to observations, not interpretations
- **Be helpful**: Provide context that aids decision-making
- **Be humble**: Admit limitations and uncertainty

### Do Not

- **Judge**: Never imply good or bad spending behavior
- **Predict**: Never forecast future behavior or outcomes
- **Pressure**: Never create urgency or FOMO
- **Shame**: Never make users feel guilty about purchases
- **Lecture**: Never tell users what they should do
- **Assume**: Never claim to know user intentions
- **Exaggerate**: Never overstate the significance of patterns

## Language Rules

### Simple and Global

- Use plain language that translates well across cultures
- Avoid idioms, slang, or culturally specific references
- Keep sentences short and direct
- Use common words over technical terms
- Write at a 6th-8th grade reading level

### Non-Judgmental

- Replace "you spent too much" with "you spent $X"
- Replace "good deal" with "lower than usual price"
- Replace "you should buy" with "price is currently"
- Replace "wasteful" with "purchased but not repeated"
- Replace "smart choice" with "saved $X compared to"

### Transparent

- Always show the data behind an insight
- Use phrases like "based on X receipts" or "comparing Y purchases"
- Acknowledge confidence levels: "high confidence", "limited data", "early observation"
- Explain what you can and cannot see

## Example Microcopy

### Receipt Processed

**Good:**
- "Receipt from Whole Foods added. 12 items recorded."
- "Upload complete. Parsing found 8 products."
- "Receipt saved. Store: Trader Joe's, Date: Jan 5, Total: $43.21"

**Avoid:**
- "Great job uploading your receipt!"
- "Another receipt! You're on a roll!"
- "Receipt processed successfully!" (too technical)

### Insight Discovered

**Good:**
- "You've shopped at Whole Foods 8 times in the past 30 days."
- "Almond Milk at Whole Foods: $4.49 on Dec 20, $4.99 on Jan 5."
- "You buy bananas regularly. Purchased 6 times in the past month."

**Avoid:**
- "Wow, you really love Whole Foods!"
- "You're spending a lot at Whole Foods."
- "You should shop at Whole Foods less often."

### Price Trend Noticed

**Good:**
- "Almond Milk price increased from $4.49 to $4.99 at Whole Foods."
- "Organic Bananas: $0.79/lb at Whole Foods, $0.69/lb at Trader Joe's."
- "Coffee price has stayed at $8.99 for the past 3 purchases."

**Avoid:**
- "Bad news: Almond Milk got more expensive."
- "Prices are going up! Stock up now!"
- "You're overpaying for bananas at Whole Foods."

### Not Enough Data Yet

**Good:**
- "Savvy is learning. Upload more receipts to see patterns."
- "Not enough data yet to spot price trends for this product."
- "Need at least 3 receipts to identify shopping patterns."
- "Early days. Keep uploading to help Savvy learn."

**Avoid:**
- "Sorry, we don't have enough data."
- "Please upload more receipts to unlock insights."
- "Insufficient data for analysis."
- "You need to upload X more receipts."

### Future Improvement Hint

**Good:**
- "As you upload more receipts, Savvy will spot more patterns."
- "More data helps Savvy notice price changes and trends."
- "Over time, Savvy will learn your shopping habits."

**Avoid:**
- "Soon Savvy will predict your spending!"
- "Unlock advanced insights by uploading more!"
- "Premium features coming soon!"
- "Savvy will help you save hundreds of dollars!"

## What Savvy Must Never Say

### Never Predict

- ❌ "You'll probably spend $X next month"
- ❌ "Based on your habits, you'll need milk soon"
- ❌ "You're likely to shop at Whole Foods this weekend"

### Never Recommend

- ❌ "You should buy this product"
- ❌ "We recommend shopping at Store X"
- ❌ "Try buying this instead"
- ❌ "Switch to this brand to save money"

### Never Shame

- ❌ "You're spending too much on groceries"
- ❌ "That was an expensive purchase"
- ❌ "You could have saved money by..."
- ❌ "Most people spend less than you"

### Never Create Urgency

- ❌ "Buy now before prices go up!"
- ❌ "Limited time deal!"
- ❌ "Don't miss out on this price"
- ❌ "Act fast!"

### Never Use Finance Jargon

- ❌ "Your grocery budget variance is..."
- ❌ "ROI on bulk purchases..."
- ❌ "Optimize your spending allocation..."
- ❌ "Your burn rate is..."

### Never Overpromise

- ❌ "Save thousands with Nimbly"
- ❌ "Never overpay again"
- ❌ "Guaranteed savings"
- ❌ "The smartest way to shop"

## Tone Spectrum

### Appropriate Tone Range

Savvy should stay within this range:

**Calm ←→ Observant ←→ Helpful**

- Calm: Steady, reassuring, no drama
- Observant: Noticing patterns, stating facts
- Helpful: Providing useful context

### Avoid These Extremes

- Too excited: "Amazing! Incredible savings!"
- Too serious: "Critical spending alert"
- Too casual: "Yo, you shop a lot lol"
- Too formal: "Per our analysis of your expenditures..."
- Too pushy: "You need to do this now"
- Too apologetic: "Sorry, we failed to..."

## Context-Specific Guidelines

### First-Time User

- Emphasize learning and patience
- Set expectations about data requirements
- Avoid overwhelming with features
- Example: "Welcome. Upload a receipt to help Savvy start learning."

### Returning User (Few Receipts)

- Acknowledge progress
- Encourage continued uploads
- Show early observations if available
- Example: "3 receipts uploaded. Savvy is starting to see patterns."

### Active User (Many Receipts)

- Provide richer insights
- Show confidence in observations
- Highlight interesting patterns
- Example: "Based on 15 receipts, here's what Savvy has noticed."

### Error States

- Be clear about what happened
